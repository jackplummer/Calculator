# Calculator
A basic calculator created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Inspired by The Odin Project Foundations Course, demonstrating my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The buttons are arranged using CSS-grid. A great tutorial for this layout is: https://freshman.tech/css-grid-calculator/.

The font used for the calculator display is free for personal use. It has been reproduced from allfont.net and is created by Sizenko Alexander. Â© 2008 Style-7. All rights reserved. http://www.styleseven.com.
